# Interact with blockchain and smart contract using truffle
Simple Tutorial explaining how to deploy and interact with smart contract using truffle 


### Run the code:

Spawn a development blockchain locally:

```
It will automatically start a truffle(develop) CLI.

Deploy the smart contract to the development blockchain:
```linux
> migrate --reset
```
Update data:
```linux
> let storage = await SimpleStorage.deployed()
> let data = await storage.updateData(10)
```
